## Background 
As I have grown older, I have developed a deep love for dogs, and now find them to be the perfect companion. However it was not always this way, as I used to have a significant fear of dogs. I vividly recall a moment where I ran around in a circle, screaming, while being chased by a tiny, fluffy puppy. Nonetheless, my love for dogs has only increased and now I wish to use my passion to help other make data-driven decisions before adopting adopting or purchasing a dog with this dataset. By analyzing this data, I hope to uncover insights into when and why dogs bite and create a dashboard that others can use to make informed decisions regarding dog ownership. Whether a dog is on the top biters list or not, this information could be invaluable to those considering bringing a fury friend home.

## Plan
My goal of this dataset is to help people considering buying a dog, but are not certain about the breed,age, and the possible violence associated with having a dog.
I obtained this dataset through Nyc Open data's website. I will drop a link if interested in viewing the original dataset for yourself. I was able to download a csv of the data and imported it into a google sheets file where I can then begin the analyze phase of the project. 

## Analyze 
Here in the analyze phase I began cleaning the data. This includes removing any duplicate values, null values, outliers, and potentially misleading data that would skew my results. I also used many advanced level formulas such as if statements, vlookups, conditional formatting to put the data into the correct form to start analyzing it. Then, I began to go into exploratory data analysis with the help of pivot tables so I could find trends and insights that I felt were excting to share and to put in my visualizations. Once I formualted what I wanted to show visually it was time to construct it. 

## Construct 
Now that I have the data cleaned, done exploratory data analysis within google sheets with the help of pivot tables, I can now begin to show my insights visually. For this project I used Google Data Studio which is now refered to as Looker Studio. With this dataset I provided many visualizations such as tables,bar graphs, heat map, and straight text. Using this dashboard I am now able to share my findings.
