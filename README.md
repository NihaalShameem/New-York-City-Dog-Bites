# 📉 NYC Operational Risk & Trend Analysis
### *Optimizing Public Safety Resource Allocation using 9 Years of Incident Data*

### 📊 Project Overview
**Role:** Lead Data Analyst  
**Tools:** SQL Server (T-SQL), Python (Pandas), Tableau, Excel  
**Dataset:** NYC Department of Health (2015-2024 Data)  
**Status:** [Completed]

**The Challenge:** The NYC Department of Health was operating on pre-pandemic safety models. Stakeholders needed to know if the post-2020 landscape had changed and how to optimize limited enforcement resources.

**The Solution:** I conducted a strategic audit of 9 years of incident data using advanced SQL (Window Functions, CTEs, Rolling Averages) to identify hidden risk factors, forecast staffing needs, and propose an evidence-based resource allocation strategy.

## 📖 Executive Summary
My analysis revealed that **2024 was the most volatile year on record**, shattering the pre-pandemic baseline. The data suggests this surge is not random, but driven by three systemic factors:

1. A **"Compliance Gap"** in Spay/Neuter rates for specific demographic segments.

2. The **"Pandemic Echo"**, with a wave of under-socialized subjects reaching maturity.

3. **Geographic Inequality**, specifically in veterinary access in The Bronx.
