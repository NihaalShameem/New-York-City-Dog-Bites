## Background 
As I have grown older, I have developed a deep love for dogs, and now find them to be the perfect companion. However it was not always this way, as I used to have a significant fear of dogs. I vividly recall a moment where I ran around in a circle, screaming, while being chased by a tiny, fluffy puppy. Nonetheless, my love for dogs has only increased and now I wish to use my passion to help other make data-driven decisions before adopting adopting or purchasing a dog with this dataset. By analyzing this data, I hope to uncover insights into when and why dogs bite and create a dashboard that others can use to make informed decisions regarding dog ownership. Whether a dog is on the top biters list or not, this information could be invaluable to those considering bringing a fury friend home.
