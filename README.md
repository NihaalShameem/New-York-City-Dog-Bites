## Background 
As I have grown older, I developed a deep love for dogs, and now find them to be the perfect companions. However, it was not always this way, as I used to have a significant fear of dogs. I vividly recall a moment where I ran around in a circle, screaming, while being chased by a tiny, fluffy puppy. Nonetheless, my love for dogs has only increased and now I wish to use my passion to help others make data-driven decisions before adopting or purchasing a dog. By analyzing this data, I hope to uncover insights into when and why dogs bite and create a dashboard that others can use to make informed decisions regarding dog ownership. Whether a dog is on the top biters list or not, this information could be invaluable to those considering bringing a fury friend home.

## Plan
My goal with this dataset is to help people considering buying a dog, but who are not certain about the breed, age, and the possible violence associated with having a dog.
I obtained this dataset through New York City Open data's website.(NYC) I will provide a link if interested in viewing the original dataset for yourself. I was able to download a .CSV of the data and imported it into a Google Sheets file where I can then begin the analyze phase of the project. 

## Analyze 
In the anlysis phase I began cleaning the data. This includes removing any duplicate values, null values, outliers, and potentially misleading data that would skew my results. I also used many advanced level formulas such as if statements, vlookups, conditional formatting to put the data into the correct form to start analyzing it. Then, I began to go into exploratory data analysis with the help of pivot tables so I could find trends and insights that I felt were excting to share and to put in my visualizations. Once I formualted what I wanted to show visually it was time to construct it. 

## Construct 
After the data was cleaned, exploratory data analysis within Google Sheets with the help of pivot tables, allows a visual representation of insights. For this project I used Google Data Studio which is now refered to as Looker Studio. Within this dataset I provided many visualizations such as tables, bar graphs, heat map, and straight text. Using this dashboard I am able to share my findings. 

## Share 
From analyzing the datset I found many insights that could help potential dog owners with their selection! 
- Pitbulls were the most vicious dogs in NYC from the dataset by a significant margin followed by mixed breeds, Shih Zhu, and German Shepards. (Pitbull - 35% of bites, Mixed- 13%, German Shepard 7%, and Shih Tzu at 9%)
- Most of the dogs that bite were between the ages of 1 and 5. This could mean that one is better off getting a dog from birth to self-train them or to obtain an older dog that has already been trained for a couple of years. 
- The borough with the most bite cases was Queens, followed by Manhattan, and lastly Brooklyn. Progressive years and dog bites have a negative relationship, this means that as the years have gone by between 2015 and 2022 dog bites have declined. 
- Male dogs accounted for more than 70% of bites, while females only accounted for 27%. One other insight I found interesting was whether a dog being spayed or neutered made it prone to attack more. From putting the data into a pivot table it seemed that 51% were neutered and spayed while 49.5% were not. At first it showed a difference was not apparent, but then I added breed and it showed that the top dogs that were prone to bite were not spayed or neutered!
